**Discussion group** <http://groups.google.com/group/gtm-oauth>

The Google Toolbox for Mac OAuth Controllers make it easy for Cocoa
applications to sign in to services using OAuth for authentication and
authorization.

Features include:
- Complete embedded user interface using WebKit
- Works with Google APIs and with any standard OAuth provider
- Handles sign-in, keychain storage of authorization token, and signing of requests
- Independent of other projects

**To get started** with GTM OAuth, read the
[wiki](https://github.com/google/gtm-oauth/wiki).

**If you have a problem** or want a new feature to be included in the library,
please join the [GTM-OAuth discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/gtm-oauth)
or submit an [issue](https://github.com/google/gtm-oauth/issues).

The library incorporates the
[GTM HTTP Fetcher project](https://github.com/google/gtm-http-fetcher/).

This project is for controllers for services using the OAuth 1 protocol.
There is a separate project for [OAuth 2 controllers](https://github.com/google/gtm-oauth2).

Other useful classes for OS X and iOS developers are available in the
[Google Toolbox for Mac](https://github.com/google/google-toolbox-for-mac/).
